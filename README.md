🎬 FlixBattle

FlixBattle is an interactive web application where users vote between two entertainment options — movies, series, or pop-culture icons — and see live results update instantly.

The project focuses on clean UI, intuitive UX, and core React fundamentals, built step-by-step as a scalable MVP.

🚀 Live Concept

Choose. Vote. Set the Trend.

Users are presented with two options in a “battle” format and can:

Vote for their favorite

See real-time percentage results

Move through multiple battles seamlessly

🧠 Key Features

⚔️ Battle-based voting system

📊 Live vote percentages with animated progress bars

🔁 Next Battle navigation with circular flow

🔢 Battle counter (Battle X of Y)

🌙 Dark cinematic theme

⚡ Instant UI updates using React state

📱 Clean, responsive layout foundation

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React (Create React App)

Routing: React Router

Styling: CSS (modular, scalable)

State Management: React Hooks (useState)

Data Handling: Local mock data (extensible to backend)

⚙️ How It Works (High Level)

Battle data is loaded from a local data file

React state tracks:

Current battle index

Votes for each option

Vote percentages are calculated dynamically

Progress bars visually represent results

Users can move to the next battle seamlessly

The UI automatically re-renders when state changes — no manual DOM manipulation.
